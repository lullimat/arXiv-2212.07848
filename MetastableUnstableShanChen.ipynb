    "We quantitatively characterize the metastability in a multi-phase lattice Boltzmann model. The structure factor of density fluctuations is theoretically obtained and numerically verified to a high precision, for all simulated wave-vectors and reduced temperatures. The static structure factor is found to consistently diverge as the temperature approaches the critical-point or the density approaches the spinodal line at a sub-critical temperature. Theoretically predicted critical exponents are observed in both cases. Finally, the phase separation in the unstable branch follows the same pattern, i.e. the generation of interfaces with different topology, as observed in molecular dynamics simulations. All results can be independently reproduced through the \"idea.deploy\" framework [https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy](https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy)"

Since there are some issues in executing these scripts in the Jupyter environment we include them as separated files which are called from the cells themselves. **In order to reproduce the plots a working 'latex' installation is necessary to be present on the system.**\n",
